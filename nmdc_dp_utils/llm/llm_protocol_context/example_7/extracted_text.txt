Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was sequentially extracted from bulk soils using ultrapure DI water at two temperatures. Sequential water extracts were collected by extracting 1 g bulk soil with 30 mL of ultrapure DI water in a combusted (450 °C for 5 h) borosilicate glass centrifuge tube. To extract cold water extractable organic matter (C-WEOM), a proxy of DOM (von Lützow et al. 2007), samples were shaken at 20 °C for 2 h in a water shaking bath (Fisherbrand Isotemp Shaking Water Bath; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). After 2 h, samples were centrifuged (6000 rpm for 8 min), and C-WEOM in supernatant was collected, leaving the soil behind. The C-WEOM solution was filtered using a combusted fritted glass filter assembly (DWK Life Sciences LLC, Millville, NJ, USA) and combusted glass fiber filters size F (0.7 μm, Whatman GF/F, 450 °C for 5 h). For the hot water extractable organic matter (H-WEOM), which serves as a proxy of labile SOM (von Lützow et al. 2007), 30 mL of ultrapure DI water was added to the extracted soils and allowed to shake in a hot water bath at 80 °C for 16 h. After 16 h, the samples underwent the same sample processing as C-WEOM. Samples were diluted sixfold to ensure that the concentration would not interfere with analysis and stored at 4 °C until analyzed.

DOM sequential extraction and mass spectrometry analysis
Sequential water, methanol, and chloroform extractions were completed at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab (EMSL), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national user facility, using a modified method from Tfaily et al. (2017). Water extracts are a proxy for labile DOM, chloroform extracts are a proxy for lipids associated with minerals and cellular membranes, and methanol extracts have characteristics intermediate between water and chloroform extracts (Tfaily et al. 2015, 2017; Graham et al. 2017). Soil extracts were prepared in triplicate by adding 5 mL of solvent (water, methanol, or chloroform) to 1 g air-dried, sieved bulk soil from each composited horizon in 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes (Olympus 50 mL Centrifuge Tubes; Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) and shaken on an orbital shaker (150 rpm for 2 h). Soils were allowed to settle before spinning down and collection of supernatant. This process was repeated adding methanol and chloroform sequentially to the extracted soils. The water and methanol extracted organic matter underwent solid phase extraction (SPE) to desalt samples and improve signal. Prior to SPE, methanol extracts were diluted with ultrapure DI water, and both water and methanol extracts were acidified to a pH of 2 with H3PO4. SPE cartridges (Bond Elut PPL, 100 mg bed mass, 3 mL volume, non-polar; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were primed with 1 mL of methanol prior to adding acidified extract. Once the acidified extract had completely run through, the SPE cartridge was rinsed with 15 mL of 10 mM HCl to remove contaminants. The SPE cartridge was dried using lab air, and after the cartridge was completely dry, the sample was eluted off using 1.5 mL of methanol. Extracts were stored in 2 mL MicroSolv vials at −80 °C until analysis.


Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) of DOM SOP

Bond Elut PPL SPE:
1.	Place labeled SPE cartridge (Agilent, Cat# 12105004) onto SPE vacuum manifold (Sigma-Aldrich (Supelco), Cat# 57250-U) with 15mL falcon tube underneath to collect waste.
2.	Prepare 5mL* of H2O sample in a 15mL Olympus tube (Genesee Sci., Cat# 28-103) by acidifying the sample to at least pH2 with 2µL of 37% HCl.
a.	Depending on sample volume, sample may need to be diluted to 5mL with MilliQ H2O.
b.	Depending on sample alkalinity and natural buffers within the sample, more 37% HCl may be needed to acidify the sample to pH2. 
c.	Test acidity with 0-6pH strip by pipetting 20µL of the sample on the pH strip.
3.	Activate each SPE cartridge with 3mL of Optima LC/MS-grade methanol and let excess drain off into waste.
4.	Equilibrate cartridge with 5mL 10mM HCl.
5.	Load the acidified sample onto the cartridge and allow the sample to flow through the column#.
6.	Wash the cartridge 17X+, # with 3mL of 10mM HCl, emptying waste tubes into a larger waste container once they are 80% full.
7.	Dry each cartridge with N2(g) until packing material returns to original color (about 5 minutes)
a.	If top filter has moved during drying, tamp down gently with pipette tip.
8.	After cartridge is dry, expel any remaining HCl rinse in cartridge port and solvent guide needle by gently pushing N2(g) through the port.
9.	Replace cartridge onto original port and elute with 1.5mL of Optima LC/MS-grade MeOH into a 2mL Microsolv vial (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-WCV) and cap with a non-slit cap (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-10C-B-M) until ready to run. Sample is then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC
*More than 5mL of sample can be used, especially if total volume of sample received is greater than 5mL and/or is of low concentration
#If samples are having a hard time flowing through with gravity and capillary action, gently pull vacuum to pull the sample or solvent through the column
+ Samples can be rinsed more than 17X depending on salt concentration
