 Metabolomics protocols (LC-MS)

 Sample preparation

The samples were prepared by Melissa Esposito, Kevin Ngoc, Fernando Vargas, and Louis Felix Nothias (nothias@ucsd.edu) from the [Dorrestein Lab at University of California San Diego](https://dorresteinlab.ucsd.edu/).

 Sample extraction
All solvents and reactants used were LC-MS grade. To maximise the extraction yield, the samples were prepared differently based on their sampling method (bulk, filter, swabs, controls), and organised on seven 96-well plates depending on depending on their environmental package (host-associated, misc. environment, sediment, soil, microbial mat/biofilm, water, plant-associated, and wastewater/sludge).
 
1. The swabs were transferred in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based), and dissolved in 1.0 mL of 9/1 EtOH/H2O. The plate was put in an µLtrasonic bath for 30 min, and after 12 hours at 4°C, the swabs were removed from the wells. 
2. The filter samples were dissolved in 1.5 mL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O, and the tubes were put in an µLtrasonic bath for 30 min. After 12 hours at 4°C, the filters were removed from the tubes, and the supernatant was collected in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based). 
3. The bulk samples were dissolved in 7/3 MeOH/H2O, in a volume varying from 600 µL to 1.5 mL depending on the available amounts, and homogenized in a tissue-lyser (QIAGEN) at 25 Hz for 5 min. Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based). 
4. For the material control samples (bags, filters, and tubes) 3.0 mL of 2/8 MeOH/H2O were added and 1.5 mL were recovered after two minutes, and added as control wells in the 96 well plates (polypropylene-based). 

	After the extraction, the plates were dried with a vaccum concentrator.

 Solid phase microextraction (SPE)
	
This SPE step is done to remove both salts (reduce ionisation efficiency), very polar compounds (not retained by C18 LC column) as well as very apolar compounds that would carry over runs.
	
1. The samples (in plates) were dissolved in 300 µL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O, and put in an µLtrasound bath for 20 min. 
2. Solid phase extraction were performed with SPE plates (Oasis HLB, Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance, 30 mg with particle sizes of 30 um).
	- 	The SPE beds were activated with 100% MeOH, and equilibrated with 100% H2O.
	-   The samples were loaded on the SPE beds, and 100% H2O was used as wash solvent (600 µL). The eluted solution was discarded (it contains salts and very polar metabolites that are subsequent analysis are not designed for).
	-   The sample elution was carried out sequentially with 7/3 MeOH/H2O (600 µL) and with 100% methanol (600 µL). 
	-   The obtained plates were dried with a vaccum concentrator.
3. Preparation for mass spectrometry analysis
	-	The samples were resuspended in 130 µL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O containing 0.2 uM of amitriptyline as internal standard. 
	-   The plates were centrifugated at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C
	-   100 µL of samples were transferred into a new 96 well plate (polypropylene-based) for mass spectrometry analysis.

 Metabolomics protocols (GC-MS)

 Extraction

The extraction and GC-MS mass spectrometry experiments were performed by Sneha Couvillion (sneha.couvillion@pnnl.gov) at the [Thomas Metz laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://omics.pnl.gov/staff-page/Metz/Tom).

Two protocols were used- one for the 105 soil samples and another for the 356 ‘fecal’ (mostly non-soil samples we received from UCSD) samples. For biosafety reasons, the batch of 356 fecal samples were processed in the biological safety cabinet, thus requiring a slightly modified protocol.

The sample derivatization protocol consists of a two steps: First, methoxyamination is performed to protect ketones and aldehydes. Then trimethylsilylation (using MSTFA) to increase volatility, thermal stability and improve chromatographic separation.

 Sample preparation protocol

 Soil samples (105 samples)
1. Weighed and labeled each soil sample and stored in the -70 freezer 
2. 12 samples removed at a time for processing
3. 1mL of water added to each tube plus one scoop of garnet/SS beads and 1 UFO shaped stainless steel (SS) bead
4. Each sample lysed on the Tissue Lyser for 3 minutes at 30Hz
5. Samples transferred into 15mL tubes using a lab spatula, 1mL of ice-cold water used to rinse the smaller tube and combined into the 15mL tube
6. 10mL of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol added to each sample using a glass serological pipette and rotated at 4C for 10 minutes. 
7. The samples were then placed inside the -70C freezer for 10 minutes
8. The samples were spun at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate phases
9. The top and bottom layers were combined into large glass vials and dried down until almost dry and froze at -20
10. The protein interlayer and debris were discarded 
11. The following day 1mL of 2:1 was added to each large glass vial and the sample was transferred into 1.5mL Sorenston tubes, spun at 12,000xg to remove debris.
12. The supernatant was transferred into smaller flat bottom glass MS vials and dried all the way down for analysis.
13. The following day the next 12 samples were prepared until all 105 samples were done. 


 Fecal samples (356 samples)
1. MPLex (in Bio safety cabinet)
	
	a. Transfer 100 uL of each pellet to a 2.0-mL Sorenson microcentrifuge tube using a 100 uL scoop (Next Advance, MSP01).
	- Note: The use of a 100 uL scoop proved to not be as useful as expected due to the complication of getting the sample into the scoop while trying to keep it as frozen as possible. After the first few attempts, the amount of sample transferred was approximated using visual estimation of quantity.
	
	b. Bring final volume of sample to 1.5 mL ensuring the solvent ratio is 3:8:4 H2O:CHCl3:MeOH by adding the appropriate volumes of H2O, MeOH, and CHCl3.  For example, a volume of 1.5 mL would require 0.3 mL water, 0.8 mL chloroform, and 0.4 mL methanol. Do not count the sample pellet against any of the volumes added.
	
	- Process for mixing after transfer:

		1. Add 100 uL of 3 mm stainless steel beads (chloroform washed) to each tube	
		2. Day of extraction add 400 uL chilled methanol and keep tubes on ice (this is to prevent the sample from refreezing after transfer to save time)
	
		3. Add 300 uL chilled nanopure water and vortex to mix for 30 seconds.
		4. Add 800 uL chilled chloroform and vortex to mix for 30 seconds.
		5. Transfer out of BSC wiping with a bleach wipe.
		6. Transfer any remaining, unused sample from the hood (wiping with a bleach wipe) directly into liquid nitrogen and store at -70C.

	c. Outside the BSC:
	 
	- Separate the layers by centrifugation (Outside BSC): 10k x g for 10 minutes at 4C.

	- Collect Samples:

		1. Remove top layer (polar metabolites) and bottom layer (nonpolar lipids) and transfer into ALS (Microsolv) vial.  SpeedVac to dryness and store at -20C until ready to prepare for GC-MS analysis (to be prepared by Meagan Stevens).
		2. Discard the protein layer.
		3. 

 Derivatization for GC-MS analysis

1. Make a methoxyamine solution with a pyridine concentration of 30 mg/mL 
2. Dry aqueous metabolites briefly (>30 min.) again in SpeedVac if the samples were stored in a freezer
3. Perform methoximation by adding 20 µL of methoxyamine solution to the sample vial and vortex for 30 s at setting 5 on vortexer. Use a bath sonicator to ensure the sample is completely dissolved.
4. Incubate the sample in the oven maintained at 37°C for 1 hr and 30 mins with 1000 rpm shaking.
5. Invert the vial one time to mix the samples with condensed drops at the cap surface.
6. Spin the sample down for 1 minute at 1k x g at room temperature in a centrifuge.
7. Perform silylation by adding 80 µL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide and 1% 
trimethylchlorosilane (MSTFA) solution using a syringe and vortex for 10 s.
8. Incubate the sample in the oven maintained at 37°C for 30 mins with 1000 rpm shaking.
9. Invert the vial one time to mix the samples with condensed drops at the cap surface
10. Spin the sample down for 5 minute at 2k x g at room temperature in a centrifuge.
11. Transfer the reacted solution into two vials (if running in duplicate) which already have inserts inside of them
12. Tighten the caps and put the auto sampler tray for GC-MS analysis
