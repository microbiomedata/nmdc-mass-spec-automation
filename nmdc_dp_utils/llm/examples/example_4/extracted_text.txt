Sample growth medium for metabolomics: Uncap the septa. Draw all EcoFAB
growth medium with a sterile syringe attached to a needle. Remove the needle, attach
a 0.2 µm filter to the syringe, and filter the spent medium into a 15 mL tube (if clotting
occurs, replace the filter). Store the filtrate at -80°C.
