This is the protocol that I used. The sample masses are adjusted differently but the solvent ratios are the same. 

Modified Folch Extraction SOP

For Soils >10%C:
1.	User will have pre-weighed 300mg* of soil into a 15mL Olympus tube (Genesee Sci., Cat# 28-103)
2.	1mL of MilliQ H2O will be added to the sample and put on a vortex mixer (Thermo Scientific, Cat# 88880017TS) at RT and 1000 RPM for 2 hours.
3.	Centrifuge sample at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
4.	Pull off supernatant using 200uL micropipette while avoiding disturbing and pulling up sediment and place in a pre-labeled 2mL Sorensen tube (part no.) [It is always made sure that most of the supernatant is taken off]. Supernatants are then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC.
5.	2mL of Optima LC/MS-grade MeOH is added to the sample using a glass serological pipette and vortexed for 5 seconds.
6.	4mL of EtOH-stabilized CHCl3 is added to the sample in a fume hood using a glass serological pipette and vortexed for 5 seconds.
7.	0.25mL of MilliQ H2O are added to the sample using a micropipette and sample is placed on a vortex mixer at RT and 1000 RPM for 1 hour.
8.	1.25mL of MilliQ H2O are added to the sample and given a gentle shake by hand to get a bi-layer separation.
9.	Sample is then incubated overnight at 4oC
10.	Centrifuge sample at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
11.	In a fume hood, pull off bottom layer (lipid layer) using a 9” glass Pasteur pipette and split sample between a pre-lableled 2ml glass Mircosolv vial (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-WCV) and a pre-labeled Waters vial (Waters, Cat# 186002805) and cap both with non-slit caps (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-10C-B-M) (IF PLASTIC MICROPIPETTE TIPS ARE USED, SAMPLES WILL BE CONTAMINATED WITH PEG AND UNUSABLE). Samples are then placed in separate sample boxes and stored at -80oC
12.	Centrifuge sample again at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
13.	Pull off top layer (metabolite layer) using a 1mL micropipette or 9” glass Pasteur pipette and transfer supernatant into pre-labeled 2mL glass Microsolv vial (if using micropipette be careful not to plunge tip below bi-layer if there is remnant CHCl3). Sample is then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC 
Modified Folch Extraction SOP

For Soils and Sediments <10%C:
1.	User will have pre-weighed 2g* of soil into a 15mL Olympus tube+ (Genesee Sci., Cat# 28-103)
2.	5mL of MilliQ H2O will be added to the sample and put on a vortex mixer (Thermo Scientific, Cat# 88880017TS) at RT and 1000 RPM for 2 hours.
3.	Centrifuge sample at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
4.	Pull off supernatant using 200uL micropipette while avoiding disturbing and pulling up sediment and place in a pre-labeled 15mL Olympus tube [It is always made sure that most of the supernatant is taken off]. Supernatants are then stored on their sides to prevent cracking at -80oC.
5.	4mL of Optima LC/MS-grade MeOH is added to the sample using a glass serological pipette and vortexed for 5 seconds.
6.	8mL of EtOH-stabilized CHCl3 is added to the sample in a fume hood using a glass serological pipette and vortexed for 5 seconds.
7.	0.50mL of MilliQ H2O are added to the sample using a micropipette and sample is placed on a vortex mixer at RT and 1000 RPM for 1 hour.
8.	2.50mL of MilliQ H2O are added to the sample and given a gentle shake by hand to get a bi-layer separation.
9.	Sample is then incubated overnight at 4oC
10.	Centrifuge sample at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
11.	In a fume hood, pull off bottom layer (lipid layer) using a 9” glass Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15mL Olympus tube (IF PLASTIC MICROPIPETTE TIPS ARE USED, SAMPLES WILL BE CONTAMINATED WITH PEG AND UNUSABLE). Samples are then concentrated using N2 evaporator.
12.	Centrifuge sample again at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes on an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
13.	Pull off top layer (metabolite layer) using a 1mL micropipette or 9” glass Pasteur pipette and transfer supernatant into pre-labeled 2mL glass Microsolv vial (if using micropipette be careful not to plunge tip below bi-layer if there is remnant CHCl3). Sample is then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC 

*Amount of soil can vary by how much sample the user has available as well as the type of soil 
+Depending on bulkiness of soil can also be done in 50mL tube
