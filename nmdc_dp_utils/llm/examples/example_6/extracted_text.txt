For Lybrand: 300mg of sample were weighed into 2mL Microsolv vials and had the sequential extraction protocol done on them (1mL H2O shaken for 2h at 2000rpm on a thermomixer, followed by MeOH and CHCl3 in that order [Tfaily et al, 2016]). H2O samples were SPE’d following normal SPE protocol (Modified Dittmar et al, 2008 [attached]). CHCl3 samples were run on ICR and through lipidomics pipeline

Sequential Extraction SOP

For soils with >10%C:
1.	User will have weighed 300mg* of soil into a 2mL glass Microsolv vial (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-WCV) with a non-slit cap (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-10C-B-M).
2.	1mL of MilliQ H2O is pipetted into each sample and shaken on a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Cat# 2231000667) at RT and 2000 RPM for 2 hours.
3.	Centrifuge samples at 4500 RPM for 5 minutes on a plate spinner that accommodates 54 sample autosampler tray.
4.	Pull off supernatant using 200uL micropipette while avoiding disturbing and pulling up sediment and place in a pre-labeled 2mL Sorensen tube (part no.) [Make sure that most of the supernatant is taken off or else this will affect the rest of the extraction]. Supernatants are then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC.
5.	1mL of Optima LC/MS-grade methanol is pipetted into each sample and shaken on a thermomixer at RT and 2000 RPM for 2 hours.
6.	Centrifuge samples (Repeat Step 3)
7.	Pull of supernatant using 200uL micropipette (Step 4) but instead place supernatant into a pre-labeled 2mL Microsolv vial and capped with a non-slit cap. Supernatants are then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC.
8.	1mL of ethanol-stabilized chloroform is pipetted into the sample using a glass syringe or a pre-marked Pasteur pipette in a fume hood (IF PLASTIC MICROPIPETTE TIPS ARE USED, SAMPLES WILL BE CONTAMINATED WITH PEG AND UNUSABLE). Samples are then shaken on a thermomixer at RT and 2000 RPM for 2 hours.
9.	Centrifuge samples (Repeat Step 3)
10.	In a fume hood, pull off supernatant using 5-3/4” glass Pasteur pipette and transfer supernatant to 2mL glass Microsolv vial and cap with non-slip cap. Supernatants are then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC.

For Soils and Sediment with <10%C:
1.	User will have weighed 2g* of soil into a 15mL Olympus tube (Genesee Sci., Cat# 28-103).
2.	5mL of MilliQ H2O is pipetted into each sample and shaken on a vortex mixer (Thermo Scientific, Cat# 88880017TS) at RT and 1000 RPM for 2 hours.
3.	Centrifuge samples at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes in an angled rotor that accommodates 15mL falcon tubes.
4.	Pull off supernatant using 1mL micropipette while avoiding disturbing and pulling up sediment and place in a pre-labeled 15mL Olympus tube [Make sure that most of the supernatant is taken off or else this will affect the rest of the extraction]. Supernatants are then stored at -80oC with tubes resting on their sides to prevent cracking.
5.	Steps 2-4 are then repeated with the supernatant going into the same sample tube as before.
6.	5mL of Optima LC/MS-grade Methanol is pipetted into each sample and shaken on a vortex mixer at RT and 1000 RPM for 2 hours.
7.	Centrifuge samples (Repeat Step 3).
8.	Pull of supernatant using 1mL micropipette the same as the H2O fraction. Supernatants are then stored at -80oC.
9.	5mL of ethanol-stabilized chloroform is pipetted into the sample using a glass serological pipette in a fume hood (IF PLASTIC MICROPIPETTE TIPS ARE USED, SAMPLES WILL BE CONTAMINATED WITH PEG AND UNUSABLE). Samples are then shaken on a vortex mixer at RT and 1000 RPM for 2 hours.
10.	Centrifuge samples (Repeat Step 3).
11.	In a fume hood, pull off supernatant using 9” glass Pasteur pipette and transfer supernatant to 15mL Olympus tube. Supernatants are then stored at -80oC.


*Amount of soil can vary by how much sample the user has available as well as the type of soil e.g. peat will be less dense/fluffier and have more C than a permafrost sample and thus 300mg of soil would be more than necessary and would most likely not fit into a 2mL Microsolv vial. 



Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) of DOM SOP

Bond Elut PPL SPE:
1.	Place labeled SPE cartridge (Agilent, Cat# 12105004) onto SPE vacuum manifold (Sigma-Aldrich (Supelco), Cat# 57250-U) with 15mL falcon tube underneath to collect waste.
2.	Prepare 5mL* of H2O sample in a 15mL Olympus tube (Genesee Sci., Cat# 28-103) by acidifying the sample to at least pH2 with 2µL of 37% HCl.
a.	Depending on sample volume, sample may need to be diluted to 5mL with MilliQ H2O.
b.	Depending on sample alkalinity and natural buffers within the sample, more 37% HCl may be needed to acidify the sample to pH2. 
c.	Test acidity with 0-6pH strip by pipetting 20µL of the sample on the pH strip.
3.	Activate each SPE cartridge with 3mL of Optima LC/MS-grade methanol and let excess drain off into waste.
4.	Equilibrate cartridge with 5mL 10mM HCl.
5.	Load the acidified sample onto the cartridge and allow the sample to flow through the column#.
6.	Wash the cartridge 17X+, # with 3mL of 10mM HCl, emptying waste tubes into a larger waste container once they are 80% full.
7.	Dry each cartridge with N2(g) until packing material returns to original color (about 5 minutes)
a.	If top filter has moved during drying, tamp down gently with pipette tip.
8.	After cartridge is dry, expel any remaining HCl rinse in cartridge port and solvent guide needle by gently pushing N2(g) through the port.
9.	Replace cartridge onto original port and elute with 1.5mL of Optima LC/MS-grade MeOH into a 2mL Microsolv vial (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-WCV) and cap with a non-slit cap (Microsolv, Cat# 9502S-10C-B-M) until ready to run. Sample is then placed in a sample box and stored at -80oC
*More than 5mL of sample can be used, especially if total volume of sample received is greater than 5mL and/or is of low concentration
#If samples are having a hard time flowing through with gravity and capillary action, gently pull vacuum to pull the sample or solvent through the column
+ Samples can be rinsed more than 17X depending on salt concentration
