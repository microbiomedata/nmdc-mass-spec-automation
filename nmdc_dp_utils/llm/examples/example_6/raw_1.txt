For Lybrand: 300mg of sample were weighed into 2mL Microsolv vials and had the sequential extraction protocol done on them (1mL H2O shaken for 2h at 2000rpm on a thermomixer, followed by MeOH and CHCl3 in that order [Tfaily et al, 2016]). H2O samples were SPE’d following normal SPE protocol (Modified Dittmar et al, 2008 [attached]). CHCl3 samples were run on ICR and through lipidomics pipeline
