For these samples, 500mg of sample were weighed out and I did a H2O extraction (2mL water) followed by a Folch. 

Folch Extraction:
1.	Water extraction (2mL H2O, shake for 2hr) 
2.	Add 2mL MeOH and vortex 5 seconds
3.	Add 4mL CHCl3 and vortex 5 seconds (glass Pasteur pipette)
4.	Add 0.25mL H2O and shake for 1hr
5.	Add 1.25mL H2O and give gentle shake to get bi-layer separation
6.	Incubate at 4oC overnight 
7.	Pull off each layer individually (Top layer is metabolite layer; Bottom layer is lipids [take this layer off with glass Pasteur pipette])
