Hi Montana,
 
For these samples, 500mg of sample were weighed out and I did a H2O extraction (2mL water) followed by a Folch.

These samples were ran in Feb of 2018.  I just need to know if you followed a seq ext protocol or shake extracted each sample separately.  I will just send her the paper for reference or you can forward her the protocol you used.

Hello Rosey!
 
We’re working on metadata for the user project 49483- Jeff Blanchard. We have a lot of metadata for the samples from protoapps. It looks like Erika did the metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics via MPLEx. I noticed the FTICR extracts say Methanol, Water, Chloroform. I suspect that means that a subsample of MPLEx isn’t what was used for FTICR, but rather you did a separate extraction. Could you confirm that? And possible share a protocol that would’ve been followed for these?
 
Thanks!
Montana Smith
