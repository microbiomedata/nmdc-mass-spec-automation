 Metabolomics protocols (LC-MS)

The LC-MS-based metabolomics experiments were designed to extract and detect a large spectrum of middle polarity metabolites due to the fact that:

	- The extractions were carried out with 7/3 MeOH/H2O.
	- Solid phase extraction (SPE) was performed with a mixed polarity stationary phase. 
	- The LC was performed in reversed-phase with a C18 stationary phase column. 

It is understood that, while LC-MS based metabolomics is a sensitive method, it is NOT a universal detection method and thus is highly compositional. In the present protocol, metabolites are detected only if:
	
	- The metabolites are soluble in the extraction can be detected.
	- The metabolites were recovered from the SPE process.
	- The metabolites are eluting over C18-based column chromatography.
	- The metabolites can be ionised in a electrospray ionisation source in positive ionisation mode.
	- The ions formed are above the limit of detection of the intrument.
	- The ions are annotated only if a fragmentation spectrum (MS/MS) is collected.

 Sample preparation

The samples were prepared by Melissa Esposito, Kevin Ngoc, Fernando Vargas, and Louis Felix Nothias (nothias@ucsd.edu) from the [Dorrestein Lab at University of California San Diego](https://dorresteinlab.ucsd.edu/).

 Sample extraction
All solvents and reactants used were LC-MS grade. To maximise the extraction yield, the samples were prepared differently based on their sampling method (bulk, filter, swabs, controls), and organised on seven 96-well plates depending on depending on their environmental package (host-associated, misc. environment, sediment, soil, microbial mat/biofilm, water, plant-associated, and wastewater/sludge).
 
1. The swabs were transferred in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based), and dissolved in 1.0 mL of 9/1 EtOH/H2O. The plate was put in an µLtrasonic bath for 30 min, and after 12 hours at 4°C, the swabs were removed from the wells. 
2. The filter samples were dissolved in 1.5 mL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O, and the tubes were put in an µLtrasonic bath for 30 min. After 12 hours at 4°C, the filters were removed from the tubes, and the supernatant was collected in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based). 
3. The bulk samples were dissolved in 7/3 MeOH/H2O, in a volume varying from 600 µL to 1.5 mL depending on the available amounts, and homogenized in a tissue-lyser (QIAGEN) at 25 Hz for 5 min. Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected in a 96 well plate (polypropylene-based). 
4. For the material control samples (bags, filters, and tubes) 3.0 mL of 2/8 MeOH/H2O were added and 1.5 mL were recovered after two minutes, and added as control wells in the 96 well plates (polypropylene-based). 

	After the extraction, the plates were dried with a vaccum concentrator.

 Solid phase microextraction (SPE)
	
This SPE step is done to remove both salts (reduce ionisation efficiency), very polar compounds (not retained by C18 LC column) as well as very apolar compounds that would carry over runs.
	
1. The samples (in plates) were dissolved in 300 µL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O, and put in an µLtrasound bath for 20 min. 
2. Solid phase extraction were performed with SPE plates (Oasis HLB, Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance, 30 mg with particle sizes of 30 um).
	- 	The SPE beds were activated with 100% MeOH, and equilibrated with 100% H2O.
	-   The samples were loaded on the SPE beds, and 100% H2O was used as wash solvent (600 µL). The eluted solution was discarded (it contains salts and very polar metabolites that are subsequent analysis are not designed for).
	-   The sample elution was carried out sequentially with 7/3 MeOH/H2O (600 µL) and with 100% methanol (600 µL). 
	-   The obtained plates were dried with a vaccum concentrator.
3. Preparation for mass spectrometry analysis
	-	The samples were resuspended in 130 µL of 7/3 MeOH/H2O containing 0.2 uM of amitriptyline as internal standard. 
	-   The plates were centrifugated at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C
	-   100 µL of samples were transferred into a new 96 well plate (polypropylene-based) for mass spectrometry analysis.


 Mass Spectrometry Analysis (non targeted LC-MS/MS)

The analysis were Louis Felix Nothias (nothias@ucsd.edu) from the [Dorrestein Lab at University of California San Diego](https://dorresteinlab.ucsd.edu/).

Samples were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (Vanquish, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific) operating in data-dependent acquisition mode (LC-M/MS in DDA mode). 

 Chromatography
Chromatographic separation was done using a Kinetex C18 1.7 µm  (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA), 100 Å pore size, 2.1 mm (internal diameter) x 50 mm (length) column with a C18 guard cartridge (Phenomenex). The column was maintained at 40°C. The mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). Chromatographic elution method was set as follows: 0.00-1.00 min, isocratic 5% B; 1.00-9.00 min, gradient from 5% to 100% B; 9.00-11.00 min, isocratic 100% B; and followed by equilibration: 11.00 -11.50 min, gradient from 100% to 5% B; 11.50 - 12.50 min, isocratic 5% B. The flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min.

 Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry was performed in electrospray ionization, in positive mode, was performed using a heated electrospray ionization source with the following source parameters: spray voltage, +3496.2 V; heater temperature, 363.90°C; capillary temperature, 377.50°C; S-lens RF, 60 (arb. units); sheath gas flow rate, 60.19 (arb. units); and auxiliary gas flow rate, 20.00 (arb. units). The MS1 scans were acquired at a resolution (at m/z 200) of 35,000 in the 100-1500 m/z range, and the MS2 scans at a resolution of 17,500 from 0 to 12.5 min. The automatic gain control (AGC) target and maximum injection time were set at 1 x 10^6 and 160 ms for MS1 scans, and set at 5 x 10^5 and 220 ms for MS2 scans, respectively. Up to three MS2 scans in data-dependent mode (TOP3) were acquired for most abundant ions per duty cycle, with a starting value of m/z 50. Higher-energy collision induced dissociation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 20, 30, 40 eV. The apex trigger mode was used (4 to 15 sec), the isotopes were excluded and dynamic exclusion was set to 11 seconds. The major background ions originating from the SPE were excluded manually from the MS2 acquisition.

 Batch preparation
The injections were randomized within a plate. Blanks samples were analyzed every 20 injections. QCmix samples were injected at the beginning, the middle, and the end of each plate sequence. The chromatographic shift observed throughout the batch is estimated as less than 2 seconds, and the relative standard deviation was +/- 15% per replicates. The samples are containing the internal standards (amitriptyline, m/z 278.19, 3.81 min). 





 Metabolomics protocols (GC-MS)

 Extraction

The extraction and GC-MS mass spectrometry experiments were performed by Sneha Couvillion (sneha.couvillion@pnnl.gov) at the [Thomas Metz laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://omics.pnl.gov/staff-page/Metz/Tom).

Two protocols were used- one for the 105 soil samples and another for the 356 ‘fecal’ (mostly non-soil samples we received from UCSD) samples. For biosafety reasons, the batch of 356 fecal samples were processed in the biological safety cabinet, thus requiring a slightly modified protocol.

The sample derivatization protocol consists of a two steps: First, methoxyamination is performed to protect ketones and aldehydes. Then trimethylsilylation (using MSTFA) to increase volatility, thermal stability and improve chromatographic separation.

 Sample preparation protocol

 Soil samples (105 samples)
1. Weighed and labeled each soil sample and stored in the -70 freezer 
2. 12 samples removed at a time for processing
3. 1mL of water added to each tube plus one scoop of garnet/SS beads and 1 UFO shaped stainless steel (SS) bead
4. Each sample lysed on the Tissue Lyser for 3 minutes at 30Hz
5. Samples transferred into 15mL tubes using a lab spatula, 1mL of ice-cold water used to rinse the smaller tube and combined into the 15mL tube
6. 10mL of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol added to each sample using a glass serological pipette and rotated at 4C for 10 minutes. 
7. The samples were then placed inside the -70C freezer for 10 minutes
8. The samples were spun at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate phases
9. The top and bottom layers were combined into large glass vials and dried down until almost dry and froze at -20
10. The protein interlayer and debris were discarded 
11. The following day 1mL of 2:1 was added to each large glass vial and the sample was transferred into 1.5mL Sorenston tubes, spun at 12,000xg to remove debris.
12. The supernatant was transferred into smaller flat bottom glass MS vials and dried all the way down for analysis.
13. The following day the next 12 samples were prepared until all 105 samples were done. 


 Fecal samples (356 samples)
1. MPLex (in Bio safety cabinet)
	
	a. Transfer 100 uL of each pellet to a 2.0-mL Sorenson microcentrifuge tube using a 100 uL scoop (Next Advance, MSP01).
	- Note: The use of a 100 uL scoop proved to not be as useful as expected due to the complication of getting the sample into the scoop while trying to keep it as frozen as possible. After the first few attempts, the amount of sample transferred was approximated using visual estimation of quantity.
	
	b. Bring final volume of sample to 1.5 mL ensuring the solvent ratio is 3:8:4 H2O:CHCl3:MeOH by adding the appropriate volumes of H2O, MeOH, and CHCl3.  For example, a volume of 1.5 mL would require 0.3 mL water, 0.8 mL chloroform, and 0.4 mL methanol. Do not count the sample pellet against any of the volumes added.
	
	- Process for mixing after transfer:

		1. Add 100 uL of 3 mm stainless steel beads (chloroform washed) to each tube	
		2. Day of extraction add 400 uL chilled methanol and keep tubes on ice (this is to prevent the sample from refreezing after transfer to save time)
	
		3. Add 300 uL chilled nanopure water and vortex to mix for 30 seconds.
		4. Add 800 uL chilled chloroform and vortex to mix for 30 seconds.
		5. Transfer out of BSC wiping with a bleach wipe.
		6. Transfer any remaining, unused sample from the hood (wiping with a bleach wipe) directly into liquid nitrogen and store at -70C.

	c. Outside the BSC:
	 
	- Separate the layers by centrifugation (Outside BSC): 10k x g for 10 minutes at 4C.

	- Collect Samples:

		1. Remove top layer (polar metabolites) and bottom layer (nonpolar lipids) and transfer into ALS (Microsolv) vial.  SpeedVac to dryness and store at -20C until ready to prepare for GC-MS analysis (to be prepared by Meagan Stevens).
		2. Discard the protein layer.
		3. 

 Derivatization for GC-MS analysis

1. Make a methoxyamine solution with a pyridine concentration of 30 mg/mL 
2. Dry aqueous metabolites briefly (>30 min.) again in SpeedVac if the samples were stored in a freezer
3. Perform methoximation by adding 20 µL of methoxyamine solution to the sample vial and vortex for 30 s at setting 5 on vortexer. Use a bath sonicator to ensure the sample is completely dissolved.
4. Incubate the sample in the oven maintained at 37°C for 1 hr and 30 mins with 1000 rpm shaking.
5. Invert the vial one time to mix the samples with condensed drops at the cap surface.
6. Spin the sample down for 1 minute at 1k x g at room temperature in a centrifuge.
7. Perform silylation by adding 80 µL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide and 1% 
trimethylchlorosilane (MSTFA) solution using a syringe and vortex for 10 s.
8. Incubate the sample in the oven maintained at 37°C for 30 mins with 1000 rpm shaking.
9. Invert the vial one time to mix the samples with condensed drops at the cap surface
10. Spin the sample down for 5 minute at 2k x g at room temperature in a centrifuge.
11. Transfer the reacted solution into two vials (if running in duplicate) which already have inserts inside of them
12. Tighten the caps and put the auto sampler tray for GC-MS analysis



 Instrument specifications and settings

An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used for all analyses. A HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies) was used for untargeted analyses. Samples (1 μL) were injected in splitless mode, and the helium gas flow rate was determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The injection port temperature was held at 250°C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60°C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325°C by 10°C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325°C. Data were collected over the mass range 50–550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8–C28) was analyzed together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.
