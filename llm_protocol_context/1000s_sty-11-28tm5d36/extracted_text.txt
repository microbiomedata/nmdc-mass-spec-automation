Collaborators shipped all cores to EMSL on ice within 24 hr of
core collection for immediate processing. One 30-cm core was
dedicated to a biotic workflow for time sensitive measurements, and
the other 30-cm core was dedicated to an abiotic workflow for
structural and hydraulic characterization (Figure 1B). To account
for surface heterogeneity, three of the 10 cm cores were
homogenized with the top 10 cm of the larger biotic core. A full
list of data types generated by the 1000 Soils Pilot is available in
SI Table 1.
Immediately on arrival (<48 hr), we processed the biotic core by
separating it into 10 cm depth intervals, which were then sieved at 4
mm. The middle section was archived, and all analyses were
conducted on homogenized top (0-10 cm) and bottom (deepest 10
cm) sections as described below. We measured microbial biomass C
and N via chloroform fumigation (30–32). Aliquots of K2SO4
extractions from the initial (background) steps of microbial
biomass measurements were archived at - 20° C for later analysis
of NO3
- via Cd-reduction method and NH4
+ via spectroscopic
determination (33, 34). Inorganic P was extracted from each soil
section via Bray or Olsen extraction (depending on pH) and
subsequent analysis via methods outlined in (35, 36). We collected
sub-samples of soil for DNA extraction and subsequent metagenomic
sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq platform (stored at -80° C). We
measured soil pH using a 1:1 soil to water ratio using a calibrated pH
probe. Gravimetric water content was determined via oven drying at
60° C. Remaining soil from each section was air dried prior to the
analyses below. b-glucosidase potential activity and respiration rates
were measured using colorimetric assays and the CO2 burst method.

Ion concentrations from 1:10 ammonium acetate extraction (K, Ca,
Mg, Na) and 1:2 soil to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA)
extraction solution (Zn, Mg, Cu, Fe, B, SO4
2--S) extraction were
measured with Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS),
while SOM concentration was determined by total organic
carbon-total nitrogen (TOC-TN) analysis and composition from
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS)
analysis. Details on SOM characterization are provided in the SI.
The abiotic core was used to determine soil structure and
hydraulic properties. We used X-ray computed tomography
(XCT) to measure soil pore size, connectivity, distribution, and
volume, as detailed below. In addition, soil hydraulic properties
were measured using a series of instruments by The Meter Group
(KSat, Hyprop, WP4C, Meter Group, Inc., USA).
Detailed methods for data collection and analysis for XCT and
FTICR-MS can be found in the SI.
