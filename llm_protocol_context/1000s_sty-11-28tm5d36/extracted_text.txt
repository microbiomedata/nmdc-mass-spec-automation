Collaborators shipped all cores to EMSL on ice within 24 hr of
core collection for immediate processing. One 30-cm core was
dedicated to a biotic workflow for time sensitive measurements, and
the other 30-cm core was dedicated to an abiotic workflow for
structural and hydraulic characterization (Figure 1B). To account
for surface heterogeneity, three of the 10 cm cores were
homogenized with the top 10 cm of the larger biotic core. A full
list of data types generated by the 1000 Soils Pilot is available in
SI Table 1.
Immediately on arrival (<48 hr), we processed the biotic core by
separating it into 10 cm depth intervals, which were then sieved at 4
mm. The middle section was archived, and all analyses were
conducted on homogenized top (0-10 cm) and bottom (deepest 10
cm) sections as described below. 

SOM was extracted from soils using 6 g of air-dried soil with 30 mL of ultrapure DI water. Soil water mixtures were shaken for 2 hours at 800 rpm. After shaking, soil mixtures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 8 minutes. The supernatant was collected and divided into aliquots for TOC/TN, LC-MS and FTICR-MS. Aliquots collected for TOC/TN and LC-MS were filtered using an ultrapure DI rinsed 0.45 um PES filter and stored frozen until analysis. TOC/TN was determined via Shimadzu TOC-TN analyzer. The aliquot for LC-MS was lyophilized and concentrated to 50x using an 80:20 methanol:water mixture prior to analysis. LC-MS spectra were collected. Concentrated OM samples were analyzed using the Q-Exactive 2 with, using a Hilic column, samples and run in both positive and negative mode. FTICR-MS samples were acidified to pH 2 using concentrated phosphoric acid and salts were removed using Agilent Bond Elut PPL SPE cartridges. 
A 7 Tesla (7T) Bruker scimaX Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR-MS) (Bruker, scimaX, Billerica, MA, USA), was used to collect high-resolution mass spectra of the SOM water extracts. Solutions were injected directly into the instrument using a custom automated direct infusion cart that performed two offline blanks between each sample. The FTICR-MS was outfitted with a standard electrospray ionization (ESI) source, and data was acquired in negative mode with the needle voltage set to +4.0kV. Data is collected from 150 m/z – 1000 m/z at 8M and in 2-omega mode.
