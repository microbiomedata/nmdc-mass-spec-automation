Leaf, root, and rhizosphere soil samples for metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were collected as
separate samples in the field and processed as follows. Roots from each sample were placed in a ceramic or
stainless-steel mortar, bathed in liquid nitrogen. Rhizosphere soil samples (consisting of soil originally adhering
to the root samples collected from the same sample bag) was immediately subsampled and refrozen. To focus
on the most biologically active portion of the root sample, roots <2 mm in diameter were quickly separated
using tweezers from overall samples in the mortar, placed into a new tube on dry ice while processing, and then
refrozen. Subsamples from all three metabolomic sample types (leaf, root, and rhizosphere) were then frozen
in liquid nitrogen and ground using a SPEX Geno/Grinder system. The remainder of the root sample available
after the metabolomics preps was then used for plant transcriptomic analyses. However, because the amount of
material remaining in some cases was not enough for RNA extraction 18 (of 109) samples were omitted. Root
transcriptomics samples were prepared for extraction by freezing fine roots in liquid nitrogen within a 50 mL
grinding jar and grinding for 30 s with a steel ball at 30 Hz on a Retch MM400 Mixer Mill. Total RNA was then
extracted 100 mg of ground material from each sample using a combined method that included CTAB lysis
buffer and a Spectrum Total Plant RNA extraction kit (Sigma) as described previously25. RNA was then shipped
to JGI on dry ice for cDNA preparation and sequencing.

Extractions for metabolomic analyses were then further prepared by JGI. For general non-targeted metabolomic
analysis by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS), polar and non-polar metabolites
were extracted from rhizosphere soil, leaf, and ground root tissue using a methanol-based extraction. Here,
leaf and root samples were first frozen and lyophilized dry (FreeZone 2.5 Plus, Labconco), then powderized by
bead-beating using a FastPrep-24 5 G (MP Biomedicals) for 5 seconds (2x) using a 2 mm stainless steel bead.
To extract leaf and root metabolites, 1 mL of 100% methanol was added to 300–400 mg powderized root tissue
or 500–600 mg powderized leaf tissue in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes, briefly vortexed, sonicated 10 minutes in an
iced water bath, centrifuged 5 minutes at 4000 rpm, then supernatant containing extracted metabolites were
transferred to new 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and dried in a SpeedVac (SPD111V, Thermo Scientific). To extract
soil metabolites, 4 mL of 100% methanol was added to ~500 mg soil samples in a 15 mL Falcon tube, briefly
vortexed, sonicated 10 minutes in an ice water bath, then centrifuged 5 minutes at 4000 rpm. Supernatants were
then syringe-filtered using 0.45 μm hydrophilic PVDF membranes (Pall), transferred to 5 mL Eppendorf tubes
and dried in a SpeedVac. Dried metabolite extracts were stored at −80 °C until ready for LC-MS.
For quantitative LC-MS, dried sample extracts were resuspended in 100% methanol containing isotopically
labeled internal standards (5–50 μM of 13C, 15N Cell Free Amino Acid Mixture, #767964, Sigma; 1 μg/

1 μg/mL 13C-D-sucrose, #CLM-8091, CIL). Resuspension volumes were varied for each sample to normalize
by initial biomass (200 μL per 150 mg for leaf and root, 200 μL per 500 mg for rhizosphere soil). Either 150 or
200 μL of resuspended sample volume were then centrifuge-filtered (0.22 μM hydrophilic PVDF membrane,
#UFC30GV00, Millipore) and transferred to glass LC-MS vials.
Within the targeted identifications files, observations that exceed level 1 represent our highest level of confidence
in that they match the fragmentation data, expected retention time, and have no confounding signals
within our mass tolerance for the precursor m/z. Towards a larger scope of potential compound identifications,
several observations within the targeted analysis match only the expected retention time and precursor m/z;
while these are considered Level 1 identifications, they are far lower confidence than the aforementioned observations.
The largest possible scope of potential compound identifications can be seen in the untargeted data.
These matches are only when fragmentation data from our experiment agrees with fragmentation data from
authentic standards. These identifications should be considered as putative identifications but nevertheless can
be extremely useful to advance discovery due to their broad coverage of the metabolome.
