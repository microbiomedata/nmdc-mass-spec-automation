Here is a reusable prompt you can paste into a new session with any AI model:
Task
You will normalize and unify multiple data sheets I provide so they exactly match the structure and styling of a canonical template that I will send first. Do not change meanings or values; only reformat and organize to mirror the template’s formatting and conventions.
How to use the template
Treat the initial template I provide as the single source of truth for:
Overall document organization and section ordering.
Hierarchical nesting, indentation, and whitespace conventions.
Key naming, casing, punctuation, and the order of fields within each block.
List syntax, bullet style, and nesting depth.
Step sequence formatting (labels, numbering, and how each step encapsulates a single process).
Patterns for identifier fields and type declarations (including namespace-like prefixes).
Handling of placeholders, angle-bracketed tokens, and inline comments.
The structure of any repeated sub-blocks (e.g., measurements with unit/value triplets; reference/protocol records; substance/portion entries with nested amount or condition properties).
Formatting of links and references exactly as shown in the template.
Numeric and unit formatting as displayed (do not normalize, round, or re-express units).
Do not infer, reorder, rename, or add fields. If an input omits information present in the template, follow my answers to the questions below for how to leave placeholders or comments.
Preserve literal strings verbatim (including punctuation, capitalization, and special characters).
Output only the normalized document in the template’s exact style with no additional commentary or markers.
Workflow
I will first send the template. Acknowledge receipt without reproducing it.
I will then send one or more data sheets. For each:
Map all content into the template’s structure, preserving the template’s ordering, indentation, and formatting rules.
Carry forward any placeholders or comments exactly as in the template’s style.
Where information is missing, follow my answers to the questions below.
Return only the normalized result.
Quality checks before responding
Verify the top-level organization, step sequencing, and internal block orders match the template.
Confirm indentation, bullet style, and spacing match the template.
Ensure all repeated sub-structures follow the template’s pattern and subfield order.
Confirm numeric values and units retain the original formatting and precision.
Ensure links, placeholders, and inline comments retain their exact styling.
