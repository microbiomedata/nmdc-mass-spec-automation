Soil metabolite and lipid extraction protocol:

1.	The 2 lyophilized sets are all about 15g each.
2.	Place soil into yellow 50mL BB tubes 
3.	Add a scoop of each SS, garnet and glass beads
4.	Add 24mL of 60% MeOH to each and bead beat at speed 8 for 10 minutes at 4C (for the unprocessed sample, the water was measured and calculated into the 60%MeOH solution). 
5.	Pour samples into 3 separate 50mL M/C compatible tubes, use 6mL of 60% MeoH to the yellow capped tube to rinse and pour 2mL into each white capped tube.
6.	Add 12mL of ice cold chloroform to each tube and probe sonicate at 60% amp for 30 seconds on ice. 
7.	Place in the -80C for ~5minutes and sonicate again as before.
8.	Spin the tubes at 3,500g for 10 minutes
9.	Collect the upper metabolite layers from the 3 tubes into 1 large glass vial and completely dry in the speed vac
10.	Using a large, flat spatula pull the protein interlayer from the 3 tubes into one new labeled 50mL tube
11.	Collect the
12.	 lipid layers into one white capped tube and store at -80C. 
13.	Add 20mL of ice cold MeOH to the protein sample, vortex, spin and discard the supernatant and lightly dry the protein pellet under N2. 

Protein digestion of pellet

14.	Add 20mL of 4% SDS, 20mM DTT in 100mM Tris-HCL, pH 5
15.	Sonicate sample into solution at 20% amp for 30 seconds each
16.	Shake at 40C for 30 minutes upright in mini shaker, 300rpm
17.	Spin at 4,500g for 15 minutes at room temp and collect supernatant into a 50mL MC compatible tube.
18.	Adjust the buffer pH to 8 using 50% NaOH and add 5mL to each pellet and sonicate back into solution and vortex.
19.	Spin at 4,500g for 10 minutes at room temp and collect supernatant into the 50mL MC compatible tube.
20.	Add 20% TCA to the supernatant and incubate at -20C for ~1-2 hours
21.	Thaw and spin out protein at 4,500g 15mins 4C. 
22.	Add 1mL of 100% ice cold acetone to TCA pellet and lightly water-bath sonicate into solution and transfer to a 1.5mL tube, use 400ul to rinse and add. 
23.	Centrifuge at 12,000g for 5 minutes at 4C. 
24.	Pour off the supernatant
25.	Dry inverted on Kim wipe
26.	Add 50ul of the extraction buffer (4% SDS, 40mM DTT in 100mM Tris-HCL, pH8) to the protein pellets and sonicate into solution.  
27.	Incubate at 95C for 5 minutes with the lids open under the thermos top with shaking at 700rpm, cool and spin out the debris at 15,000g for 5 minutes. 
28.	Remove the supernatant into a 1.5mL tube and snap freeze. 
29.	Store at -80C overnight.
30.	One spin column each, Add 400ul of 8M urea to each FASP column and add 50ul of the sample
31.	Spin at 14,000g for 30 minutes to bring the sample all the way to the dead volume.
32.	Remove the waste from the bottom of the tube (tap off the excess urea onto a Kim wipe). Add 400ul of 8M urea to the column and spin again at 14,000g for 30 minutes.
33.	Remove the waste and add 400ul of 8M urea to the column and spin as before.
34.	Add 400ul of ABC to each column and spin for 30 minutes, remove waste
35.	Add 400ul of ABC to each column and spin for 30 minutes, make sure sample is all the way to dead volume. 
36.	Remove the spin column from the collection tube and lightly clean the bottom with an alcohol wipe, to remove any excess urea from the side or underneath the column. 
37.	Place the column into a new fresh, clean and labeled collection tube.
38.	Make 75 μL Digestion Solution by dissolving 4μg trypsin in 75 μL 50mM Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution provided with the FASP Kit to a final concentration of 0.05μg/μL.
39.	Place each column in a thermomixer with a thermotop for 3hrs at 37C with shaking at 600rpm.
40.	After 3 hours add 30ul of ABC and spin out the peptides into the collection tube.
41.	Add 30ul and spin again.
42.	Remove the spin columns into waste and place a membrane on top of the collection tubes and dry down all the way and add 20ul of H2O. 
43.	No SPE
44.	BCA
45.	Vialed for Orbi
