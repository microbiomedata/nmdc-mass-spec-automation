All processing at JGI. Metabolites were extracted from 2 g soil sample size. To extract polar metabolites, 1.2 ml LC–MS water was added to soil, vortexed, then sonicated in an iced water bath for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged 5 min at 5000 rpm, vortexed again, sonicated another 4 min in an iced water bath and centrifuged (10 min at 8000 rpm). Supernatant containing extracted polar metabolites was then transferred to a new 2 ml Eppendorf, frozen and lyophilized dry (FreeZone 2.5 Plus, Labconco). To extract nonpolar metabolites, the same procedure was followed but instead of water, 1 ml of 100% MeOH added to the soil followed by vortex, sonication and centrifugation steps. Supernatant containing extracted nonpolar metabolites was then transferred to a new 2 ml Eppendorf and dried in a SpeedVac (SPD111V, Thermo Scientific). All dried extracts were stored at -80 degrees prior to LC–MS analysis.In preparation for LC-MS, samples were resuspended in 120 ul of 100% MeOH containing isotopically labeled internal standards.
