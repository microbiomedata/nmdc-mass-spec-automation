All processing at JGI. Sample processing: Briefly, roots were frozen, lyophilized dry, then bead-beaten with a stainless steel bead to powderize. Samples were extracted w/ 100% methanol (add 1 mL 100% MeOH, vortex, sonicate 10 min in iced water bath, centrifuged, then super transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf) and dried in a SpeedVac. In preparation for LC-MS, samples were resuspended in 100% MeOH containing isotopically labeled internal standards, with resuspension volume adjusted to normalize by extract TOC.
